\section{Summary / Bio}
I am an incoming MSCS student at UC Davis. 
I completed dual bachelor's degrees in Artificial Intelligence / Computer Science from the University of Manchester and 
Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020. I am passionate about machine learning and web technologies, 
adept at self-learning and collaborating with others. I worked as an MTS summer intern at the R\&D department of VMware in Beijing, 
and I also worked as a research assistant at THUNLP lab at Tsinghua University during my gap year.

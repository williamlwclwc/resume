Reliable Wiki Knowledge Graph Construction with Probabilistic Weighted Links
\begin{itemize}
    \item To make better use of the hidden knowledge in the internal links of Wikipedia that are often overlooked by the traditional KGs, 
    we constructed a reliable KG by extracting pages as the nodes, pagelinks as edges, calculating TF-IDF as the relatedness weights for each edge, 
    and filtering edges with knowledge embedding algorithms
    \item Built a front end visualization tool of the KG for debugging and demonstration
    \item 2nd authored paper (WenMai - Chinese Reliable Knowledge Graph with Probabilistic Links) has been accepted by CCKS2021 conference (with Wenhao Li, Maosong Sun, Xiaoyuan Yi)
\end{itemize}

Jiuge - Chinese AI Poem System Web Application Development
\begin{itemize}
    \item Contributed to the AI systems which have composed more than 15 million poems since 2017
    \item Lead engineer of Web Apps built with React/Vue and deployed with Nginx/Apache
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Final Year Project - Undergraduate}}{Manchester, UK \quad 2019/11 -- 2020/05}

Image-to-Image Translation Using Generative Adversarial Networks
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trained PyTorch GAN models on Google Colab based on papers Pix2pixHD and SPADE which can translate segmentation maps into photorealistic images 
    \item Applied the model to a smaller scale dataset using only less than 1/8 computing power to train
    \item Built a web app demo with Flask that allows the user to try image translation with the two models
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{VMware - MTS Intern}}{Beijing, China \quad 2019/06 -- 2019/08}

Math Knowledge Graph Web App
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clustered 25 classes of relations from more than 2000 sections of Wikipedia data using KMeans
    \item Manually labeled middle school math knowledge data in RDF triples format to build prototype demo
    \item Built Web App Demo with the Flask back end framework and the Echarts visualization tool
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Undergraduate Team Projects - Undergraduate}}{Manchester, UK \quad 2018/09 -- 2019/12}

Kalah Game AI Bot (with other 2 students)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built agents that can play the board game Kalah(Mancala)
    \item With the trick of hardcoded the first 3 steps, our Alpha-beta Pruning agent runs at least 100\% faster than before
    \item Our bot won the course's final tournament (ranked 1st)
\end{itemize}

Software Engineering Team Coursework (with a group of 5 other students)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintained a Java game Stendhal and built a website Eventlite like Eventbrite
    \item Practiced software engineering concept including estimation, code review, implementing tests, refactoring, etc.
    \item Learned frameworks such as Spring framework, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, and Thymeleaf template engine 
\end{itemize}

\section{Skills}
